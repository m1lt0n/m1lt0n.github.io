# README

This is the repository for my personal blog. It includes posts about programming and tools for software engineers.

The repository is based on the Multiterm Astro theme ( https://github.com/stelcodes/multiterm-astro ). As per the theme's instructions, the repository was cloned and I've added my own content in `content/posts`.
