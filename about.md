Hi there! My name is Pantelis Vratsalis and I am a software engineer from Greece. I fell in love with computers and software as a child and started working professionally with software in 2008.

I love coding and helping teams grow their skills. I'm a polyglot engineer (Java, Scala, Python, Ruby, Javascript, Go), working with tried and tested tools and frameworks (Vertx, Ruby on Rails, Express, Flask, Laravel, ReactJS, Vue). I enjoy working with complex codebases and big data and I have experience using the right tools for the job (Kafka, Nomad, Consul, Kubernetes, Docker).

I have managed tech teams (as Head of engineering or tech lead) and love mentoring people and grow with them, too. Having both a business and a technical background, I manage to bridge the communication gap between tech and business, which leads to great efficiency and results.
