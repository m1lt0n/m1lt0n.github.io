title: About Me
---

I am a full-stack software engineer with over a decade of experience across IC and leadership roles, building scalable systems and leading high-impact teams.

Recently, I’ve been focused on AI tooling — developing an MCP server deployed on Cloudflare, a VSCode MCP extension, and an OAuth authorization server powering integrations and partnerships with external companies.

Previously, I led multiple teams at Hotjar, including the Pricing & Packaging team, driving experimentation and platform development. That work required extensive stakeholder management — coordination with 6–8 teams per project — to ensure seamless upselling, cross-selling, and pricing experiment flows.

The tools I use frequently include: Python (Flask, FastAPI), Ruby (Rails), Node (express, fastify), React, PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka, RabbitMQ.
